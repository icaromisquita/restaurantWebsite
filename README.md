    * Styling text, images, and other elements to match a restaurant theme.
    * Implementing CSS variables for easy theming.
* **Responsive Web Design:** I learned how to make the website responsive across different screen sizes using media queries and relative units.
* **Basic Navigation:** I implemented a basic navigation menu using HTML `<a>` tags and styled it with CSS.
* **Image Optimization:** I gained experience in optimizing images for web use to improve page load times.
